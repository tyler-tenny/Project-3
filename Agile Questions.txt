3. N/A

1. I am going to set up the project files and maybe start writing some pseudocode for the project.
2. I know how to do all of the above.
3. I am not sure how to implement all of the ideas in the project in an efficient way yet.

1. I am going to keep working on the pseudocode.
2. I know how to do most of the functions in the project.
3. I am not sure how to do a menu that can be returned to after getting the matrices, or what happens if the other two options are picked without matrices selected.

March 5th
1. We are going to complete the project.
2. I know most of how to do what we're going to do.
3. I am not sure exactly how to properly output the matrices in a satisfying way.
